# The Impact of Climate Change on Agricultural Production

## Objective

This project aims to analyze the relationship between climate change variables—such as temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather events—and agricultural production, in order to understand how environmental changes impact food security and economic stability. Focusing particularly on crop yields, regional climate variations, and long-term trends, the study seeks to identify patterns in agricultural productivity under changing climatic conditions.

The primary motivation is to assess the extent to which climate change influences agricultural output and food security. By understanding how temperature fluctuations, precipitation anomalies, and extreme weather events affect crop yields, this study intends to support the development of sustainable farming strategies and climate adaptation measures. Furthermore, by analyzing the correlation between changing weather patterns, agricultural output fluctuations, and market dynamics, the project aims to contribute to the formulation of resilient agricultural policies. Such understanding is crucial for ensuring long-term food security and economic stability.

## Data and Scope

The project will analyze multiple data sources, including:  
- Climate data: temperature trends, precipitation levels, and extreme weather events  
- Agricultural production data: crop yields, total agricultural output, and regional variations  
- Food price indices to evaluate economic impacts  
- Soil moisture and drought indices to assess water availability for crops  

Examining these elements will help uncover the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and economic sustainability. The results will guide necessary adaptations in farming practices and policies to ensure stable food production amid changing environmental conditions.

## Geographic and Temporal Coverage

The study focuses on six countries selected to represent different continents: Germany, India, Nigeria, United States of America, Brazil, and Australia. The temporal scope encompasses data from 1990 to 2020. The analysis will utilize publicly available datasets, primarily FAOSTAT for agricultural yields and NASA POWER for climate variables.

## Methodology

The project will apply statistical methods such as correlation analysis alongside machine learning techniques including linear regression and random forest to model the relationship between climate factors and crop yields. Socio-economic factors will be excluded to maintain a focused analysis on environmental influences.

## Expected Outcomes

The findings are expected to deepen the understanding of how environmental changes affect food security and economic stability. This knowledge will contribute valuable insights towards developing resilient agricultural policies capable of sustaining food production under the pressures of climate change.
